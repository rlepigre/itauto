*Coq 8.18*

	- Before Coq 8.18, itauto is using the classic axiom
	`Classical,nnpp` as soon as it is loaded.  From Coq 8.18, the use
	of `Classical.nnpp` depends on the flag `Itauto Classic`.  When it
	is off, itauto` is purely intuitionistic.  When it is on, `itauto`
	is using the classic axiom `Classical.nnpp`.

	Note that this may introduce regressions for proofs
	that relied on the classic axiom.
	A possible fix consists in using the convenience module `Cdcl.Ctauto`
	(classical itauto) instead of `Cdcl.Itauto`.
